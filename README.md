Project name: Moving ball

A description of the project: 
1.	This project is an exercise project for JavaScript’s set-time function, array, and web display on html environment.
2.	There are three balls that were be mounted on the html web page. Locations of these balls changed the bound of width and height.
3.	For more vivid 3D animations, I put similar colors in the array. These arrays pick up a similar color. These patterns look 3D movement on the web screen. 


Usages:
1.	If someone looks for the solution of array, I strongly recommend the procedure of array. 
2.	For 3D movement animation, this project introduced the similar colors pop up algorithm with setTimeout function.


To enhanced upgrade this project: 
1.	I would like to introduce a container boundary which automatically adjust regardless of end-user’s devices.


During I published this project, I took the declare of array, and managed source on the Git. It also fun to assemble each of set-time function.
